Anubia: 
Hey, my name is Tim, I’m 9 years old, and I think I'm too smart for most of the kids. I don’t mean to sound like too full of myself but that’s what the doctors said to my parents. They literally said that I’m too smart for my age, which explains my way of speaking.
Mostly because of my intelligence, I go to high school with people who are 17 years old, and most of the kids think I’m a dick. I do get why I often correct them when they're wrong. Well, I’m also the youngest.
School is easy, maybe too easy. You could say that it’s nearly impossible for me to find real friends, because people keep using me or they think I’m a dick.
So, I got bored quickly and was thinking of a method to distract myself while the other kids were playing football or hide and seek. It was hard to find an activity which you're only able to do alone. But then I had it! A boomerang!      
My parents couldn't say no to me because I normally never ask for anything.
I was playing with it outside when a kid around my age came up to me asked with an ice cream in his hands “heyy, looks cool dude, want to do something together?”
“I’m sure u don’t know who I am right?” I asked
“I do, I heard a lot of things about you. You're rly smart, right? But it’s not like I care, I just want to have fun and maybe be friends. Also, I’m new here so I don’t have any friends myself” he answered. 
We started playing outside nearly every day. It was fun. I HAD FUN WITH A KID. I was impressed, I’m not going to lie. 
Friends do something I guess, they make you feel calm and happy. It got hot outside, so we made eating ice cream a tradition. Ice cream with sparkles, sauce etc.
We were best friends!

My boomerang now hangs on my living room wall to remind me that you can do stuff alone but it's more fun with friends. And, that it’s important to have some. Oh yeah nearly forgot to mention that I always have ice cream at home now ;D
