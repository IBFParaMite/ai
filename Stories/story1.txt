Anubia: I was on my way home when I saw a homeless man on the sidewalk sitting. He was reading a book and didnt seem like the kind of guy who'd be homless, I was confused.
Anubia: I walked pass him for 2 weeks and he didn't seem to move. He was always reading. I walked up to him 'ehm heey sry to disturb u but may I ask what u're reading everyday?'
Anubia: 'ohh sure kid sit down I'll tell u some true stories bout pirates, kings and queens'
Anubia: I loved the way he was telling the stories, the way he talked, the way u could see that he was loving what he was doing. I made him happy by listening and he made me happy by telling.
Anubia: I sat down for 1 h next to him for the next months. We ate some chicken nuggets and fries together. Ppl started talking but we didn't care. I was bout 11 so I didnt care bout anything.
Anubia: We laughed and discussed together. I was rly getting into history! One day I was omw to him, but ge wasn't there. The only thing I saw was blood. I asked everybody who lives around and they told me that he got killed the night cuz a guy wanted to steal his stuff.
Anubia: Death is a bitch.
Anubia: I couldn't take it, he was the grandfather I never had! Thanks to him I was an A student in history in high school.
Anubia: I still was interested in history, long story short I became a history teacher.
Anubia: Now I tell once a week true stories to children in orphanages. Im sure he'd be proud, cuz I am.
