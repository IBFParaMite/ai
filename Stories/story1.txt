Anubia: 
I was on my way home when I saw a homeless man sitting on the sidewalk. He was reading a book, and didn't seem like the kind of guy who'd be homeless, I was confused.
I walked past him for 2 weeks, and he didn't seem to move. He was always reading. I walked up to him "ehm heey, sorry to disturb you but may I ask what you've been reading everyday?"
He said to me: "ohh sure kid, sit down and I'll tell you some true stories about pirates, kings and queens".
I loved the way he was telling the stories, the way he talked, the way you could see that he was loving what he was doing. I made him happy by listening and he made me happy by telling.
I sat down for an hour next to him for the coming months. We ate some chicken nuggets and fries together. 
People started talking about us, but we didn't care. I was 11 at the time, so I didnt care about anything.
We laughed and discussed together. I was really getting into history! One day I was on my way to him, but he wasn't there. 
The only thing I saw was blood. I asked everybody who lives around and they told me that he got killed the night before because a guy wanted to steal his stuff.
Death is a bitch.
I couldn't take it, he was the grandfather I never had! Thanks to him I was an A student in history in high school.
Even after his death, I still was interested in history and continued to do well, long story short I became a history teacher.
Now, once a week, I tell true stories to children in orphanages. Im sure he'd be proud, because I am.
